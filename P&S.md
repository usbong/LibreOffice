# Problem & Solution

# 1) "Why do I need Java to run LibreOffice? Is it written in Java?"

> LibreOffice is not written in Java; it is mostly written in the C++ language. Java is one of
several languages that can be used to extend the software. The Java JRE (Java Runtime
Environment) is only required for some features. The most notable one is the HSQLDB
relational database engine used by the Base component of LibreOffice. For Calc, Java is
needed to run some of the solver engines described in Chapter 9, Data Analysis.
Java is available at no cost. More information and download links to the appropriate edition
for your operating system can be found at: https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp
